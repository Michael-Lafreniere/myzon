Having worked the last few months on a closed source C++ project I made an air-bnb clone (for CRUD) and this amazon clone site to get back into javascript, and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) with hooks development.

## Installation/Usage

[node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) is required to get `npm`. Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to install/run the-movie-site.

1. Clone the repo: `git@github.com:Michael-Lafreniere/myzon.git`
2. `cd myzon`
3. Install packages: `npm install`
4. Run it: `npm run start`
